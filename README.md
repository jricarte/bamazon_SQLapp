## bamazon_SQLapp

Bamazon is Amazon-like storefront CLI created using javascript, node and MySQL.

Using node.js, the app will take in orders that the user requests and decreases the stock of the chosen item from the store's inventory.

If the item is in stock, the order will be completed. If the item is out of stock or can't meet the user's request, the app will log a response of "insufficient quantity".
